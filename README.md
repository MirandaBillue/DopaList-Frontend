#DopaList
I personally have ADHD and I dislike the side effects of the medication, so after reading about alternatives I discoved that simple todo lists were a way to help people with ADD/ADHD focus more, and remember tasks.  So, I created DopaList to give other people with ADHD a shot of dopamine when they complete a task.
