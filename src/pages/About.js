        <p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a very common neurobehavioral 
            disorder that affects children and adolescents with impact that persists beyond 
            adolescence into adulthood. Medication and non-pharmacological treatments are 
            evidence-based interventions for ADHD in various age groups. <strong> -National Libray of Medicine</strong></p>
            <p>As humans, our brains are hard-wired to seek out behaviors that release 
                dopamine in our reward system. When you accomplish something 
                your brain releases dopamine. You feel good and you seek more of that feeling. 
                 In researching ways to treat ADHD without medication, simple todo lists, as well as 
                 meditation, a well-balanced diet, and exercise were ways to help treat symptoms without medication.
                 So we created DopaList.  A simple todo list to help people with ADHD do simple tasks,
                 and get a feel good surge of dopamine afterwards.
